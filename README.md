# COVID-19_firearm_data_PA
An R Markdown presentation on trends in firearm sales and seizures in the City of Pittsburgh and state of Pennsylvania from March to November 2020. 

In this program, I built functions to filter and aggregate FBI NICS data on background checks initiated in my state during the COVID-19 pandemic. While publicly available data on actual firearm sales is sparse, federal background check data offers some sense of the increases in firearm sales the U.S. has seen since March 2020. The program also analyzes data from my county to determine whether there has been a local increase in firearm seizures during this period of increased firearm sales. I am interested in tracking these trends month to month, and in the safety implications these trends can have on certain populations, such as those experiencing intimate partner violence during the pandemic.
