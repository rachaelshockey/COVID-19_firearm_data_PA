# COVID-19_firearm_data_PA
An R Markdown presentation on trends in firearm sales and seizures in the City of Pittsburgh and state of Pennsylvania from March to November 2020. 

In this program, I built functions to filter and aggregate FBI NICS data on background checks initiated in my state during the COVID-19 pandemic. While publicly available data on actual firearm sales is sparse, federal background check data offers some sense of the increases in firearm sales the U.S. has seen since March 2020. I am interested in tracking these trends month to month, and in the safety implications these trends can have on certain populations, such as those experiencing intimate partner violence during the pandemic.
